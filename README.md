After you've installed the plugin, go to:

- Settings > Plugins > Matrix Colors

Enter your **matrix block type handle** and the **CSS color**. Any CSS color format is valid! If you're using a hex code, be sure to include the "#" prefix.

Rinse & repeat for every block type which you'd like to assign a color to.
